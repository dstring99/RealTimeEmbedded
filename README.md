# Simulated Robot Control System

This repository contains source for a simulated robot controller. This code was run on an evaluation board for the ST Microelectronics STM32F107 microcontroller running MicroC/OS-III The Real-Time Kernel. It is a multithreaded real time application which allows new tasks to be created as robots are added to the environment.
